# byebye

`byebye` is a command line interface to logout, lock, suspend, hibernate, shutdown, reboot, from the command line on every Linux system. It detects your window manager and uses the best native command with sensible fallbacks.

Configuration details are in [CONFIG.md](file:///home/nkxxll/git/byebye/CONFIG.md).
